# Drawinsky

Create custom sketches to train your own [Quickdraw RNN](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/sequences/recurrent_quickdraw)!
This web app saves drawings stroke by stroke. With this type of data, a recurrent
neural network can be trained to predict the process of drawing certain classes
of objects.

## Getting started

- Install dependencies with `npm i`
- Start app with `npm start`
- Open browser at `http://localhost:4000`
